Best Practices
==============

A guide for programming well.

General
-------

* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask
  when in doubt.
* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* Exceptions should be exceptional.
* [Keep the code simple].

Object-Oriented Design
----------------------

* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a
  class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
* [Tell, don't ask].

Choosing open-source libraries
------------------------------

* Any new open source library needs to be approved by team after discussing it's
    * Advantages
    * Dis-advantages
    * Limitations
* Future of the library should also be considered:
    * Current stability (is it widely used and time-tested)
    * Active development or not
    * Number of maintainers

Pull Requests
-------------

* Don't create pull requests with more than one functionality.
* Pull requests will be rejected if it changes:
    * 350 lines of code in Python
    * 200 lines of code in Javascript

Python
------

* Follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Follow best practices in
    * [Writing Idiomatic Python](https://jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/) book
    * [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/)
* Don't write functions longer than 40 lines.
* Never use `lambda` functions.

Postgres
--------

* Avoid multicolumn indexes in Postgres. It [combines multiple indexes]
  efficiently. Optimize later with a [compound index] if needed.
* Consider a [partial index] for queries on booleans.
* Constrain most columns as [`NOT NULL`].
* [Index foreign keys].
* Use an `ORDER BY` clause on queries where the results will be displayed to a
  user, as queries without one may return results in a changing, arbitrary
  order.

Background Jobs
---------------

* Store IDs, not `ActiveRecord` objects for cleaner serialization, then re-find
  the `ActiveRecord` object in the `perform` method.

Email
-----

* Use [SendGrid] or [Amazon SES] to deliver email in staging and production
  environments.
* Use a tool like [ActionMailer Preview] to look at each created or updated mailer view
  before merging. Use [MailView] gem unless using Rails version 4.1.0 or later.

Web
---

* Avoid a Flash of Unstyled Text, even when no cache is available.
* Avoid rendering delays caused by synchronous loading.
* Use https instead of http when linking to assets.

JavaScript
----------
* Use the latest stable JavaScript syntax with a transpiler, such as [babel].
* Include a `to_param` or `href` attribute when serializing ActiveRecord models,
  and use that when constructing URLs client side, rather than the ID.

[babel]: http://babeljs.io/

HTML
----

* Don't use a reset button for forms.
* Prefer cancel links to cancel buttons.
* Use `<button>` tags over `<a>` tags for actions.

CSS
---

* Use Sass.
* Use [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer] to generate vendor prefixes based on the
  project-specific browser support that is needed.

[autoprefixer]: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer

Sass
----

* Prefer `overflow: auto` to `overflow: scroll`, because `scroll` will always
  display scrollbars outside of OS X, even when content fits in the container.
* Use `image-url` and `font-url`, not `url`, so the asset pipeline will re-write
  the correct paths to assets.
* Prefer mixins to `@extend`.

Browsers
--------

* Avoid supporting versions of Internet Explorer before IE10.

Shell
-----

* Don't parse the output of `ls`. See [here][parsingls] for details and
  alternatives.
* Don't use `cat` to provide a file on `stdin` to a process that accepts
  file arguments itself.
* Don't use `echo` with options, escapes, or variables (use `printf` for those
  cases).
* Don't use a `/bin/sh` [shebang][] unless you plan to test and run your
  script on at least: Actual Sh, Dash in POSIX-compatible mode (as it
  will be run on Debian), and Bash in POSIX-compatible mode (as it will
  be run on OSX).
* Don't use any non-POSIX [features][bashisms] when using a `/bin/sh`
  [shebang][].
* If calling `cd`, have code to handle a failure to change directories.
* If calling `rm` with a variable, ensure the variable is not empty.
* Prefer "$@" over "$\*" unless you know exactly what you're doing.
* Prefer `awk '/re/ { ... }'` to `grep re | awk '{ ... }'`.
* Prefer `find -exec {} +` to `find -print0 | xargs -0`.
* Prefer `for` loops over `while read` loops.
* Prefer `grep -c` to `grep | wc -l`.
* Prefer `mktemp` over using `$$` to "uniquely" name a temporary file.
* Prefer `sed '/re/!d; s//.../'` to `grep re | sed 's/re/.../'`.
* Prefer `sed 'cmd; cmd'` to `sed -e 'cmd' -e 'cmd'`.
* Prefer checking exit statuses over output in `if` statements (`if grep
  -q ...; `, not `if [ -n "$(grep ...)" ];`).
* Prefer reading environment variables over process output (`$TTY` not
  `$(tty)`, `$PWD` not `$(pwd)`, etc).
* Use `$( ... )`, not backticks for capturing command output.
* Use `$(( ... ))`, not `expr` for executing arithmetic expressions.
* Use `1` and `0`, not `true` and `false` to represent boolean
  variables.
* Use `find -print0 | xargs -0`, not `find | xargs`.
* Use quotes around every `"$variable"` and `"$( ... )"` expression
  unless you want them to be word-split and/or interpreted as globs.
* Use the `local` keyword with function-scoped variables.
* Identify common problems with [shellcheck][].

Bash
----

In addition to Shell best practices,

* Prefer `${var,,}` and `${var^^}` over `tr` for changing case.
* Prefer `${var//from/to}` over `sed` for simple string replacements.
* Prefer `[[` over `test` or `[`.
* Prefer process substitution over a pipe in `while read` loops.
* Use `((` or `let`, not `$((` when you don't need the result

Haskell
-------

* Avoid partial functions (`head`, `read`, etc).
* Compile code with `-Wall -Werror`.

Ember
-----

* Avoid using `$` without scoping to `this.$` in views and components.
* Prefer to make model lookup calls in routes instead of controllers (`find`,
  `findAll`, etc.).
* Prefer adding properties to controllers instead of models.
* Don't use jQuery outside of views and components.
* Prefer to use predefined `Ember.computed.*` functions when possible.
* Use `href="#"` for links that have an action.
* Prefer dependency injection through `Ember.inject` over initializers, globals
  on window, or namespaces. ([sample][inject])
* Prefer sub-routes over maintaining state.
* Prefer explicit setting of boolean properties over `toggleProperty`.
* Prefer testing your application with [QUnit][ember-test-guides].

[ember-test-guides]: https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.2.0/testing/

Testing

* Prefer `findWithAssert` over `find` when fetching an element you expect to
  exist

React
-------

Angular
-------

* [Avoid manual dependency annotations][annotations]. Disable mangling or use a
  [pre-processor][ngannotate] for annotations.
* Prefer `factory` to `service`. If you desire a singleton, wrap the singleton
  class in a factory function and return a new instance of that class from the
  factory.
* Prefer the `translate` directive to the `translate` filter for [performance
  reasons][angular-translate].
* Don't use the `jQuery` or `$` global. Access jQuery via `angular.element`.
